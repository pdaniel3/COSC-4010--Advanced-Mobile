This is my app. the code mostly works, but prematurely ends the connection. I have two identical games, server and client that run different bluetooth code. I borrowed much of this code from Jim Ward's bluetooth demo. The code automatically picks the first bluetooth device connected on the list of devices, so this may cause problems if there are multiple devices connected. Addtionally, Jack is just an overall, handsome, solid human being. Thank you. :smile:
